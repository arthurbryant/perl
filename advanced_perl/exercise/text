one evening, fred and barney were getting ready to go bowling.
wilma saw this and said to betty, "you should ask barney to take
you out to the hard rock cafe for pterodactyl burgers."

betty agreed. "barney and fred never think about us. we should
make it a double date."

"do you want to bring pebbles and bamm-bamm along?"

"sure," said betty. "they always like to play skee-ball."

so wilma found fred and told him, "hey, fred, you've been going
out bowling every night this week. betty and i want to go to the
hard rock cafe for pterodactyl burgers."

"but wilma," said fred, "barney and i need to go tonight. this is
the night that our league is pitted against the gravel pit
strikers. how about if i take you out on monday night?"

that wasn't good enough for wilma. "fred flintstone, if you think
i'm going to let you leave me at home with pebbles while you go
bowling for the tenth night in a row, you've got another think
coming. get cleaned up, because we're going."
